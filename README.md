**Startup operator and product leader building companies from zero to scale**

I'm the VP of Product Strategy & Operations at **[Neurologyca](https://www.neurologyca.com/)** and advisor at **[Shane Collective](https://getshane.io)**‚Äîwearing every hat that needs wearing. On any given day, I'm architecting product strategy, leading engineering execution, forging strategic partnerships with key players in the ecosystem, designing systems, building teams, and creating the operational infrastructure that turns early-stage chaos into disciplined growth.

I specialize in AI/ML product development and cross-functional leadership, building the frameworks and foundations that help companies move fast without breaking. My work spans 0-to-1 product definition, GTM strategy, business systems, and organizational design‚Äîessentially operating as product leader, technical architect, and operational backbone rolled into one.


**What I build** 
- AI-native products and intelligent automation that create real leverage
- Operational systems that scale from seed stage to enterprise
- Cross-functional teams and processes that ship quickly and sustainably
- The connective tissue between product, engineering, ops, and business strategy

**Stack:** Python, Claude, OpenAI, AWS, Snowflake, Streamlit, Flutter, Figma, Jira, Salesforce, Anaplan, Pigment, plus whatever tool solves the problem. 

**Beyond work:** volunteering with local organizations, pursuing my private pilot license, building community through gaming with friends across the globe, and exploring film and music‚Äîalways channeling curiosity into new heights!

Let‚Äôs connect, build, and create solutions that make a difference! ‚úàÔ∏èüéÆüé∂üôå
