Throughout my career, I’ve worked at the intersection of strategy, execution, and problem-solving, balancing long-term vision with rapid experimentation to deliver scalable, user-centric solutions.

❤️‍🔥**Passionate about** 
- AI/ML-powered automation & personalization
- Building intelligent, user-first products

🛠️ **Toolkit:** OpenAI, Python, Streamlit, AWS, Snowflake, SQL, Zendesk, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Jira, Figma, Miro, Anaplan, Pigment, and more. 

🌟 **Beyond work:** I volunteer with Meals on Wheels, explore film & music, and am pursuing my private pilot license—always channeling curiosity into new heights.
