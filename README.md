🚀 I’m passionate about building intelligent products, driving better decisions, and delivering exceptional outcomes. Empathy and a passion for experimentation have driven my journey across industries like Cloud Communications, SaaS, Supply Chain, and Retail, where I've created tools that empower people, optimize operations, and elevate customer experiences.

💡 As a Product Leader, I thrive at the intersection of technology and customer impact, serving both internal and external customers. From scalable ML predictive models to GenAI-powered personalization, I turn ambiguity into meaningful strategies aligned with business outcomes. My work is unified by focusing on measurable impact and transforming complexity into clarity.

🤗 I build, support, and inspire teams to deliver impactful solutions. I've led initiatives to streamline onboarding, enhance compliance, and drive intelligent automation, always keeping users at the center of the journey.

🛠️ My toolkit includes OpenAI, Python, Streamlit, AWS, Snowflake, SQL, Zendesk, ServiceNow, Salesforce, Jira, Figma, Anaplan, and Pigment, plus expertise in AI/ML projects that automate and elevate operations.

✈️ Outside work, I volunteer for Meals on Wheels, explore film and music, and pursue my private pilot license—channeling curiosity and determination into new heights. I bring this same drive and curiosity to my work, embracing challenges that demand experimentation, collaboration, and measurable outcomes.

Let’s connect and create solutions that make a difference! 🌟
